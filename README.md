# Pakistan Banking Awards Website - Frontend

Pakistan Banking Awards 2016 was the first of its kind to honoring excellence in banking. The DAWN Media Group and the Institute of Bankers Pakistan (IBP) in collaboration with A.F. Ferguson & Co, a member firm of the PwC network as their knowledge partner, held the first Pakistani awards honoring excellence in banking.

This frontend for PBA 2016 was hacked together in couple of hours on a very tight deadline.
